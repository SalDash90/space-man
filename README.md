Salman's Space Man - Game
Welcome to Salman's Space Man! This is a fun word-guessing game inspired by the classic Hangman game. Your goal is to guess the correct word by selecting letters, but be careful! You only have a limited number of attempts (lives). If you run out of lives, it's game over!

Game Overview
Objective: Guess the hidden word by selecting letters.
Lives: You start with 5 lives. Each wrong guess will reduce your lives.
Hints: Each word comes with a hint to help you guess the word.
Letters: You can guess by clicking on letters from the available alphabet.

How to Play

Game Features
Random Words: Every time you start a new game, the word and hint will be randomly selected from a predefined list.
